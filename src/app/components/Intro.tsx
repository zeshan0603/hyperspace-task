import React from 'react'

export default function Intro() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1 className='text-7xl font-bold m-10 text-center'>Hi there!</h1>
            <p>
                Thanks for giving me the chance to complete this test. I designed the Modal as a server component and incorporated a straightforward GSAP animation for the page transitions. I primarily utilized Tailwind CSS for styling. I hope you find it satisfactory!
            </p>
        </div>
    )
}
