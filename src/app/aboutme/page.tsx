          Hello! I'm Zeshan, a Computer Science graduate with a passion for web development. I have project experience in frontend development, including working with React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I have a basic understanding of various frontend technologies and frameworks.

          As a newcomer in the field, my primary interest is in showcasing my skills and tackling real-world problems rather than just securing a job. I'm eager to learn and adapt to new technologies, and I possess strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail. I believe Hyperspace is the perfect place for me to achieve this. I'm excited to meet the team and connect personally to share more about myself.

          Thanks!
        </p>
